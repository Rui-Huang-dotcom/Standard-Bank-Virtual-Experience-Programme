# Standard Bank Virtual Experience

## üìù Overview
Standard Bank is embracing the digital transformation wave and intends to use new and exciting technologies to give their customers a complete set of services from the convenience of their mobile devices. As Africa‚Äôs biggest lender by assets, the bank aims to improve the current process in which potential borrowers apply for a home loan. The current process involves loan officers having to manually process home loan applications. This process takes 2 to 3 days to process upon which the applicant will receive communication on whether or not they have been granted the loan for the requested amount. To improve the process Standard Bank wants to make use of machine learning to assess the credit worthiness of an applicant by implementing a model that will predict if the potential borrower will default on his/her loan or not, and do this such that the applicant receives a response immediately after completing their application.


##  üë®‚Äçüíª Analysis 
### 1. EDA
1. An overview of the data. (HINT: Provide the number of records, fields and their data types. Do for both).
a
2. What data quality issues exist in both train and test? (HINT: Comment any missing values and duplicates)

3. How do the the loan statuses compare? i.e. what is the distrubition of each?

4. How do women and men compare when it comes to defaulting on loans in the historical dataset?

5. How many of the loan applicants have dependents based on the historical dataset?

6. How do the incomes of those who are employed compare to those who are self employed based on the historical dataset? 

7. Are applicants with a credit history more likely to default than those who do not have one?

8. Is there a correlation between the applicant's income and the loan amount they applied for? 
- Conducted an exploratory data analysis on a loan database, unearthing valuable insights and intricate patterns.
- Utilized machine learning models to predict the likelihood of loan default, achieving a mean classification accuracy rate of 76%.
- Created interactive Tableau dashboards, providing an intuitive interface for stakeholders to access and act on valuable insights.
- Applied hypothesis testing to reveal significant relationships between specific borrower attributes and the likelihood of loan default.
